Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Priv.-Doz. Dr. José R. Crespo López-Urrutia for the opportunity to work in his group over summer, and showing me enthusiasm in science, especially during the almost bi-weekly cake meetings.

\noindent I am deeply indebted to Dr. Elwin Dijck, Mr. Christian Warnecke and Mr. Malte Wehrheim for teaching and showing me how CryPTEx is operated, as well as answering many of the technical questions I had and helping me to debug software. 

\noindent I thank the personnel and administrative staff at the MPIK for helping to ensure a productive time at the institute and for dealing with my pandemic-related issues prior to arrival. 

\noindent Finally I thank the other group members and colleagues at the MPIK, as well as my friends and housemates, who made my time in Heidelberg enjoyable and full of lessons, both within and outside physics.
